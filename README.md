# CodeSnippets

These are the snippets that I use during competitive programming.
To use this you need to create a file called cpp.json and change the settings of VS Code or any other compiler that you use.

Just make the code of the topic you want to make snipper. Then go to https://snippet-generator.app/ or just seach snipper generator on google and go to any snippet generator and make the snipper of your code. Make sure its for VScode

Then make sure you give the correct prefix and description of the code which you just wrote.
Then prefix will be the keyword by which the code will appear once you write the code.

Then just open cpp.json by doing ctrl + P. 
Save your code and you are good to go. Yay !!
